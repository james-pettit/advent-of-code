    "I'm going to start this one by writing a class and some functions that contains some useful stuff, and then start actually importing the data afterwards. The first decision that needs to be made is how to store the bingo boards, and the board state (i.e. what tiles have been called). The board state doesn't need to be stored for each board between rounds, it's probably easier to recreate it from scratch each time to see if a board is winning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most obvious way to store the boards is just as 5 lists of 5 elements each. Each element representing one number across the board, and each list representing one line of the board, top to bottom. The board state can be stored as an equivalent array of booleans. The overall set of boards can just be a list of these "
